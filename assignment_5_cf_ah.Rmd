### Results 
##### 1. Annual Salamander Counts in Old Growth (OG) and Clear Cut (CC) sections in Mack Creek.
```{r}
# Count salamanders in old growth and clear cut sections in Mack Creek for every year.
mc_vertebrates_counts <- mack_creek_vertebrates %>%
  filter(species == "DITE") %>% 
  count(year,section)

# Make a graph to visualize the counts. 
ggplot(data = mc_vertebrates_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, fill = section)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Annual Pacific Giant Salamander Counts in Mack Creek Sections", x = "Year", y = "Number of Pacific Giant Salamander", fill = "Area Section") +
